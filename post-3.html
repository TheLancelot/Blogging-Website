                     <h1>Week 3</h1>
                     <p>
                        This week was all about me getting a hold of the style of my typeface. As this font is going to be used for Britannia’s very own milk and Dahi products the font needed to be of the same nature. It took me two long weeks to get a hold of the font and how I wanted it after trial and error every day. Every time I used to share a letter designed to Vedang Sir and every time I made a mistake he used to send me a letter designed by him to make me understand that designing a typeface needs to be done after a careful examination of how the letters are going to look as a whole or from afar, or when minimized. Every detail is important.<br>
                        I understood what he meant to say which resulted in me designing the first eight letters of the alphabet series during the week.<p><br>
                        <blockquote>
                           Form and Function together create Typographic excellence.
                        </blockquote><br>
<p>
                        This week taught me that every small detail while designing is important. We often tend to love what we design but we don’t realize it until we have examined it properly, made errors, and started from scratch. If designing was that easy everyone would have become a designer. It takes great effort and thinking to have the result you want.
                        <br>
                        Thank you!<br>
