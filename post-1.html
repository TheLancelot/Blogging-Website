                  <h1>My First Week at Interbrand</h1>
                  <p>
                     Hello, welcome to my blog where I navigate through my journey of interning at the world's leading
                     brand consultancy company. I am currently a 2nd-year visual communication student at École Intuit
                     Lab and interning with one of the most well-known agencies from the past 40 years,
                     Interbrand.<br><br>
                     Before I go ahead with my work, I would like to tell you a bit about the agency and its approach to
                     design. Interbrand has pioneered iconic work and forged many of the brand-building tools that are
                     now commonplace.
                     Their main aim is to forge iconic moves for brands through strategy and creativity. By turning
                     customers into active participants. They help their clients strengthen their brands on an ongoing
                     basis- their approach gives them the confidence to make iconic moves that spark desire and create
                     unity, during extraordinary results.<br><br>
                     I was going to be working under the guidance of the executive director Lajja Marjadi and creative
                     director Vedang Shidore. I started my internship on June 13, 2022. On the day we commenced we had a
                     quick introduction on how Interbrand works. We met with the entire team, I became extremely nervous
                     and overwhelmed but everyone was extremely welcoming.<br><br>
                     I got my first solo project as soon as the introduction was done. It was scary at first but with
                     the opportunity of designing a typeface from scratch, I knew I was going to learn a lot in the next
                     two months.
                     The project was creating a Typeface for the “come alive” Britannia project. Interbrand in
                     collaboration with Britannia industries has designed the identity and packaging for Britannia’s
                     dairy portfolio to strengthen it. Vedang Sir gave tips every day on how to focus and make a font,
                     taking as much as time needed to work on every single letter. The day and the following week was
                     pretty much based on me exploring multiple variations of the letters that I was creating. Every
                     letter had to be closely examined for its curves, edges, and nature.
                     I also got to read the brand books on which Interbrand is mainly based. It was quite a lot to take
                     in at once but at the same time, I was excited to start working at Interbrand.
                     <br><br>
                     Everyone made me feel as a part of their team at the very beginning due to which I felt pretty
                     confident. Working with all senior professional designers and senior interns made me get the feel
                     of what the real industry feels like.
                     <br><br>
                     Thank you! See you next week!
                     <br>
