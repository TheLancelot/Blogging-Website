                     <h1>Week 2</h1>
                     <p>
                        It was a fresh Monday morning as I completed my first week at Interbrand. I feel confident and settled. I was briefed by Vedang Sir that to make the font I should utilize the whole two months of my internship to work on it. As I have seen in the past in my college when we had to design a typeface we hardly took two months. I heard what he said and I was a bit shocked. Nonetheless, I took his advice and got started with it.<br><br>
                        During the week as I was working on my solo project, I got a new task, a new project to work on which was to make changes to the logo of the Indian Kabaddi team UP Yodha. <br>
                        I was briefed by Sachin Mistry that I had to make changes to the logo according to the nature and style of the Indian warrior helmets, weapons, etc. It was a task that had to be done in one day. With my ongoing project, I managed to complete the logo in a single day. I was pretty amazed how I managed to complete the logo and at the same time get approved by Sachin Sir on the same day.<br><br>
                        This also gave me an understanding that being a Creative Director at Interbrand comes with a lot of responsibility and the constant need to manage time and get things done.<br>
                        This week taught me how one should be determined and hard-working in order for the result to be rewarding. All we have to put in is our creative minds.
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you!<br>
