                     <h1>Week 9</h1>
                     <p>
                        This week I was given the task of investigating a line-based drawing of all the things that are available at the petrol pump. This illustration was going to be a part of the HPCL Project of redesigning. This illustration ranged from the electric charging station to food and so on.
<br><br>
                        Later on, during the week I was asked to help with the mock-ups of this particular design and putting it all together as it was going to be presented as one of the variations to the client.
                        Not just that but I also got to work on the mock-ups of the second design variation which was really fun!
                        <br><br>
                        As my internship was coming towards an end it made me realize that I had become a part of Interbrand so quickly because everyone is so helpful, supportive, and motivating! 
                        Every week used to have a bonding session where we would play a game of chess.
                        <br><br>
                        Interning at Interbrand was a really good learning experience and I got to experience how a design firm really is in the real world. From the outside, we seem to notice how simple the design is but when we see how much work and effort has been put in and how much thought has been put to finally come up with a design is amazing.
                        <br><br>
                        I am really thankful for how much I have learned in these two months. Ending this blog here with the satisfaction that I have successfully ended my internship.

                        <br><br>
                        Thank you!<br>
